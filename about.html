    <h1>GOL D ROGER SON'S</h1>
    <p>
      Ace was placed in the custody of Marine Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp, who
      put him in the care of Curly Dadan and the Dadan Family on Mt. Colubo on
      Dawn Island.[11] During his childhood, Ace would encounter people who
      voiced their hatred of Roger and any offspring he might have, causing him
      to feel alone and worthless. <br>Once, this led to him beating some of them to
      near death, shocking Dadan. When Garp came to visit, Ace asked if he
      should have been born at all, and Garp replied he could only find that out
      by living.[12] Ace later met Sabo on Gray Terminal, which Sabo claimed to
      be from. The two shared a dream of becoming pirates and stole money and
      treasure in preparation for the day they would set off to sea. <br> I just don't
